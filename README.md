# UserPermission
In Android Operating-System, if you are a developer and if you want to get some images from the phone gallery, you should ask to user for some permissions.I was thinking "Oh, I think it will be very easy". But, I don't think like this because I learned and writed it. It is too complex. For writing this "piece of code" easily, I put my codes onto "UserPermission.kt". But you should set your ViewBinding and Navigation into gradle. And some strings in it is TURKISH. You can change them with translate if you want. And you should change the widgets(buttons, imageViews, TextViews, EditTexts. I dont now how to say them and I used "widget").

I am new in learning english so I'm sorry for my grammar mistakes.

Have a good programming
