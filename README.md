# UserPermission
In Android Operating-System, if you are a developer and if you want to get some images from the phone gallery, you should ask to user for some permissions.I was thinking "Oh, I think it will be very easy". But, I don't think like this because I learned and writed it. It is too complex. For writing this "piece of code" easily, I put my codes onto "UserPermission.kt".

I am new in learning english so I!m sorry for my grammar mistakes.

Have a good programming
